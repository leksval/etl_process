I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film It was always going to be good and sadly it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorsesIt is rare though that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film Nolan The Prestige Begins delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson
